# Implementations

The schema for data solution automation is used in various ways, by different projects. In many cases this is bespoke, integrated into company solutions and frameworks.

Other cases, software products use the schema (or parts thereof) to work towards an integrated way of sharing design metadata.

This page lists some of the known implementations:

* [Taxonomy of ETL Automation Metadata (TEAM)](https://github.com/data-solution-automation-engine/TEAM/releases) - creating and managing source-target mappings.
* [Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW)](https://github.com/data-solution-automation-engine/TEAM/releases) - code generator for data solutions.
