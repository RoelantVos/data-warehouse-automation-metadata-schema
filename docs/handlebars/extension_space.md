# {{space}}

Space will space out (!?) the name of the input value to 30 characters using tabs for alignment, indentation.

## Usage

``` handlebars
{{space "<value>"}}
```

## Example

``` handlebars
This is {{space "Hello World"}} ...spaced out.
```

This results in:

```dotnetcli
This is Hello World                                              ...spaced out.
```
